# Improving Empathy in Clash Royale: A StartHack Project
## Introduction
Clash Royale is a popular mobile game developed by SuperCell. Our team participated in the StartHack hackathon and decided to work on improving the game's empathy towards players.

## The Problem
After analyzing the game's mechanics, we found that the game can be frustrating for players who don't have access to certain cards or who are matched against players with much stronger decks. This can create an unfair playing field, making the game less enjoyable for those players.

## Our Solution
To improve empathy in Clash Royale, we developed a new social score systems algorithm that takes into account the player behaviors, as well as feedback of other players. This ensures making  the game more fair and enjoyable for everyone.

## Conclusion
Our project shows that it's possible to improve empathy in mobile games like Clash Royale. By taking into account player behaviors, we can make the game more fair and enjoyable for everyone.
